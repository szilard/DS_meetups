The State of XGBoost: history and community overview

Hyunsu Cho

Senior Systems Software Engineer, NVIDIA

What used to be a research prototype to process several GBs of data on a single workstation, XGBoost has now grown to be a production-quality software that can process hundreds of GBs of data in a cluster. In the last few years, XGBoost has added multiple major features, such as support for NVIDIA GPUs as a hardware accelerator and distributed computing platforms including Apache Spark and Dask. This talk will provide a short tour of the history of XGBoost, recognizing its major milestones. We will particularly pay attention to how XGBoost has integrated with major data science packages and frameworks, such as scikit-learn, R, Apache Spark, Dask, and RAPIDS AI. We will also share current efforts to grow the community, to put the open source project on a sustainable path. Finally, we will share the future roadmap of the project and list of wish items.

After receiving Masters degree from University of Washington, Hyunsu went to join Amazon Web Services (AWS) to develop AI as a service. He was part of initial efforts to launch Amazon SageMaker Neo in November 2018, a service to package and optimize machine learning models for serving in the cloud and in edge devices. In April 2020, Hyunsu joined the RAPIDS AI team in NVIDIA. He is now focusing on improving end-to-end data science pipelines using NVIDIA GPUs. Hyunsu has been in charge of maintaining the XGBoost project since November 2017. In addition to triaging bug reports and reviewing pull requests, Hyunsu also maintains the test farm for continuous integration (CI), which ensures that all incoming pull requests meet the quality bar.
